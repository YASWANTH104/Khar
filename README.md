## üß± How I Structured the Code

The code is organized around a class-based design:

### ‚úÖ `MobiusStrip` Class Responsibilities

- **`__init__`**: Accepts parameters `R` (radius), `w` (width), and `n` (resolution). Creates a grid over the parameter space `(u, v)` and computes the surface coordinates using the parametric equation.

- **`_compute_coordinates()`**: Uses the standard parametric equations of a M√∂bius strip to compute the 3D coordinates `(x, y, z)` for the mesh grid.

- **`surface_area()`**: Approximates the surface area numerically using vector calculus and the cross product of tangent vectors.

- **`edge_length()`**: Estimates the length of one boundary edge (since M√∂bius strips have one edge) using pairwise Euclidean distance between successive points.

- **`plot()`**: Visualizes the 3D surface using `matplotlib`.

## üìè How I Approximated Surface Area

The surface area is computed using numerical integration via differential geometry:

1. **Tangent Vectors**: First, partial derivatives of the position vector with respect to `u` and `v` are computed using `np.gradient()`.

2. **Cross Product**: The cross product of these two tangent vectors at each grid point gives a vector normal to the surface. The magnitude of this vector represents the differential area element `‚Äñ‚àÇr/‚àÇu √ó ‚àÇr/‚àÇv‚Äñ`.

3. **Summation**: The total surface area is then the sum over all small area elements scaled by the grid spacing `du * dv`.

**Mathematically:**

A ‚âà ‚à¨ ‚Äñ‚àÇr/‚àÇu √ó ‚àÇr/‚àÇv‚Äñ du dv

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

- **Twist in Topology**: The M√∂bius strip has a single side and one edge, which complicates surface and edge calculations compared to simpler surfaces.

- **Numerical Accuracy**: Ensuring smoothness and precision in gradient and area computations required fine-tuning the grid resolution (`n`). Too low a resolution gives poor estimates; too high slows down performance.

- **Edge Detection**: Because of the twist, selecting the correct edge (`v = ¬±w/2`) needed care to ensure length measurement was accurate.

- **Visualization Orientation**: Without proper labeling or orientation, 3D plots can be hard to interpret. Setting appropriate aspect ratios and axis labels helps in clear visualization.
